## üìñ Problem Statement

### Background
Streamist is a global streaming platform that offers a wide variety of web series and movies to its users. Each piece of content is rated by viewers, and additional information such as the number of viewers, number of episodes, episode duration, and more is collected for each title. Recently, Streamist has decided to focus on the anime category to better understand what drives user ratings and to improve content recommendations and acquisition strategies.

### Business Problem
Streamist wants to identify the most significant factors that influence the ratings of anime titles on their platform. By understanding these factors, Streamist aims to:
- Enhance user engagement by recommending highly-rated anime based on user preferences
- Inform content acquisition and production decisions
- Improve the overall user experience by highlighting key features that matter most to viewers

### Data Science Problem
As a data scientist at Streamist, your task is to:
1. Analyze the provided anime dataset to uncover the key factors that impact anime ratings
2. Build a predictive model (using linear regression) to estimate the rating of an anime based on its features
3. Evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results to provide actionable insights for the business

### Key Questions
- What are the most important features that influence the rating of an anime?
- How accurately can we predict the rating of an anime using the available data?
- What recommendations can be made to Streamist based on the analysis and model findings?

### Deliverables
- üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) highlighting trends, patterns, and relationships in the data
- ü§ñ A linear regression model to predict anime ratings, along with an assessment of its performance
- üí° Insights and recommendations for Streamist based on the analysis and modeling results
